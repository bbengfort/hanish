# The Hanish Weather Slackbot

Documentation for getting started and deploying the bot as well as development instructions would all be placed here. For now, the documentation is simply a stub.

## Name Origin

The name [Hanish](https://nameberry.com/babyname/Hanish) means &ldquo;one who forewarns of storms&rdquo;. The name has a literary origin, from the [Epic of Gilgamesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh_flood_myth), a legend that tells of a great flood. The thunder god, Adad, and the cloud and storm gods Shullar and Hanish all foretold of the flood by rumbling and coming over mountains and land.
