# The Hanish Weather Slackbot

Documentation for getting started and deploying the bot as well as development instructions would all be placed here. For now, the documentation is simply a stub.

While [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/) is the documentation standard for Python libraries, for applications and user-documentation, I prefer to use [MkDocs](http://www.mkdocs.org/). Primarily I make my choice based on whether or not I need to create API documentation from the docstrings in my code base. To render and serve the documentation, run the following in the root directory of the project:

    $ mkdocs serve

Note that API and code documentation is correctly formatted in RST, and could be rendered by many code-based documentation utilities. 

## Name Origin

The name [Hanish](https://nameberry.com/babyname/Hanish) means &ldquo;one who forewarns of storms&rdquo;. The name has a literary origin, from the [Epic of Gilgamesh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gilgamesh_flood_myth), a legend that tells of a great flood. The thunder god, Adad, and the cloud and storm gods Shullar and Hanish all foretold of the flood by rumbling and coming over mountains and land.
